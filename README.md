# CBR Tools Extras

CBR Tools Extras is a binary package that contains supporting functionality for [CBR Tools](https://github.com/TUM-CBR/pymol-plugins). We advise you look at that project first if you are not familiar with it. Even though this project is meant to be used in conjunction with [CBR Tools](https://github.com/TUM-CBR/pymol-plugins), it can also work as a standalone command-line application.
